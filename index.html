  I Didn't see any instructions saying to put something here so i'm gonna use
  this index for the explainations<br />

  <br />
  Internal CSS: I used the Internal CSS In the home.html tab to colorize the
  body background color to linen and the same goes for h1 (heading 1), next i
  added margin left 40px element.<br />

  <br />External CSS: For this, i created a Style.css file I styled the "p" tag
  and the "nav" tag for the "p" tag i changed the background color to lightblue
  as for the "nav" tag I changed the color to white and aligned the text to the
  center

  <br /><br />Explaining how clicking a button calls a javascript function: use
  the onclick event attribute property of the HTML button to call a JavaScript
  function. The JavaScript code provided in the onclick attribute executes when
  the button is clicked. (I couldn't get this code to work so I ended up getting
  rid of it) <br /><br />
  How i deployed my code to my github repostiory was by typing up the code in VS
  Code (Visual Code Studio) as i'm typing and saving it's added the html and all
  the different files im creating into a dedicated folder i created in my
  documents <br /><br />
  Explaining the Inline CSS: An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a
  single HTML element. <br /><br />
  Ulitily Function Explaination: The HTML Utility helps render JSON content as
  HTML and generate JSON from HTML <br /><br />
  Explaining How To Use A Button To Call A Function To Run: The onclick event
  attribute in HTML triggers when the user clicks on an element <br /><br />
